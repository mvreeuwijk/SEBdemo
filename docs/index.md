# SEBdemo — Documentation

Welcome to the SEBdemo documentation. This short site explains how the simple 1D surface energy balance + conduction model in `model.py` works, how to run the demo, and what outputs you can expect.

- [Model overview](model.md)
- [Quick start — run the demo](model.md#quick-start)
- [Governing equations](governing_equations.md)
- [Software License](LICENCE.md)

If you want the GUI, see `app.py` in the project root. The `model.py` module is written so it can be used programmatically (imported) or executed as a small demo script that runs a default simulation and shows the Results plots.
